Completing this project was a good experience as it pushed me to apply the concepts we learned in this course in a more practical manner. I was able to think through input validation and understand the principles of modular programming/clean project structure by setting a functioning module up from scratch. There weren't too many challenges I faced when doing the project since I was able to build on what we have learned in class. The most rewarding part was being able to create a tool that I can build on even further to use in my own life.
Overall, the project aided in my ability to design, document, and test a complete Python application. It also helped me connect the concepts I learned within the course to something practical.
